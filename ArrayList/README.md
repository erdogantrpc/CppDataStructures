# ArrayList
An ArrayList, or dynamically resizing array, allows you to have the benefits of an array while offering flexibility in size.
You won’t run out of space in the ArrayList since it’s capacity will grow as you insert elements.<br/>
An ArrayList is implemented with an array. When the array hits capacity, the ArrayList class will create a new array with double the capacity and copy all the elements over to the new array.<br/>
