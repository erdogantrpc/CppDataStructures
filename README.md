# CppDataStructures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

> ## ℹ️ makefile
> A makefile is used to tell the compiler which source files you want to compile. It'll also do things like name your excecutable and place it in a specific location.
> Check the [link](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/cpp/writing-makefiles/) for more information.
# Installation
In order to run the cpp programs we wrote in this hierarchy, you need to install the mingw32 compiler.
This [link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html) will help to setup.
# Run
To run the programs, you can run the exe file in the bin folder or you can run the "mingw32-make" command by going to the location where the make file is located in the folder you want to run with the terminal.
